# Basic Python Programs

Welcome to the **Basic Python Programs** folder! This section includes foundational Python scripts that cover essential concepts and provide a solid base for learning Python.

## üìÇ Contents

Here's a quick overview of the programs you'll find here:

1. **Hello World** - The classic first program for beginners to get started with Python syntax.
2. **Data Types and Variables** - Examples of different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans) and how to use variables in Python.
3. **Basic Arithmetic Operations** - Programs demonstrating addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. **Conditionals** - Examples of `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements for decision-making.
5. **Loops** - Basic loops like `for` and `while` with examples.
6. **Functions** - Introduction to defining and calling functions.
7. **Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries** - Basic data structures in Python and how to work with them.
8. **Input and Output** - Programs demonstrating how to get input from the user and display output.

## üîß Getting Started

Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific Python concept. You can run these programs directly from the command line or through a Python IDE.

To run a program, navigate to the folder containing the file and use the command: python filename.py

## üìñ Learning Objectives

These programs are designed to help you:

- Understand basic syntax and structure in Python
- Familiarize yourself with Python data types and variables
- Learn to use conditionals and loops effectively
- Practice creating functions to organize your code
- Understand Python data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries
